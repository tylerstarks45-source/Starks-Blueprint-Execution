// ─── Executive Brain (ASH Brain v2.0 — Phase 1.1 Foundation) ───────────────
//
// Mandated flow: User -> Executive Brain -> Goal Manager -> Task Planner ->
// existing AI Orchestrator -> OpenRouter -> existing Tool Execution.
//
// This module is the "Executive Brain" step only. It never calls OpenRouter
// for the user-facing reply and never executes tasks itself — it decides
// *what project/goal/tasks* this request belongs to, persists that state,
// and returns a short context note for the existing orchestrator to consume
// unchanged. If anything here fails, the caller (routes/executive-brain.ts)
// falls back to calling the orchestrator directly with zero Executive Brain
// context, so a bug in this layer can never block a user's request.
